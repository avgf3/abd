Fix: Improve online users list broadcasting in Socket.IO

Changes made:
1. Enhanced 'join' event handler to broadcast online users list to ALL users
2. Added 'request_online_users' event handler for manual refresh
3. Improved 'disconnect' event to update online users list for all users
4. Added better logging for debugging online users functionality
5. Used io.emit() instead of socket.broadcast.emit() to include current user

This ensures that the online users list is properly synchronized across all connected clients.
