# Database Connection Pool Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The application is experiencing "Max client connections reached" errors due to:

1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: Default pool limits are too low for production load
2. **No Connection Recovery**: Failed connections aren't properly cleaned up and retried
3. **Insufficient Error Handling**: Connection errors cause cascading failures

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Connection Pool Configuration

**File**: `server/database-adapter.ts`

- Increased default pool limits:
  - Without PgBouncer: 5 ‚Üí 15 connections
  - With PgBouncer: 20 ‚Üí 50 connections
- Extended connection timeouts for stability
- Added connection error handlers

### 2. Improved Retry Logic

**File**: `server/utils/database-timeout.ts`

- Enhanced `safeDbOperation` with exponential backoff
- Added connection-specific error detection
- Increased default retries from 1 to 3

### 3. Connection Recovery System

**File**: `server/database-adapter.ts`

- Added automatic connection health monitoring
- Implemented connection recovery mechanism
- Added pool status monitoring

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling

**File**: `server/utils/database-error-handler.ts`

- Categorizes database errors by type
- Provides appropriate retry strategies
- Handles connection pool exhaustion gracefully

## Environment Variables for Production

Add these to your production environment:

```bash
# Connection Pool Settings
DB_POOL_MAX=50                    # Maximum connections (increase if using PgBouncer)
DB_POOL_MIN=5                     # Minimum connections to maintain
DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300               # Keep connections alive longer (5 minutes)
DB_MAX_LIFETIME=3600              # Connection lifetime (1 hour)
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=60             # Connection timeout (1 minute)

# PgBouncer Support (if available)
USE_PGBOUNCER=true               # Enable if using PgBouncer
DB_POOL_MAX=100                  # Can be higher with PgBouncer

# Error Handling
DB_RETRY_DELAY_MS=2000           # Base retry delay
DB_MAX_ATTEMPTS=8                # Maximum retry attempts
DB_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_MS=5000        # Health check timeout
DB_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS=30000     # Connection monitoring interval

# High-Load Environments (use with caution)
DB_NO_LIMITS=true                # Removes most connection limits
```

## Recommended Production Setup

### Option 1: With PgBouncer (Recommended)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=1
USE_PGBOUNCER=true
DB_POOL_MAX=100
DB_POOL_MIN=10
```

### Option 2: Direct Connection (Fallback)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require
DB_POOL_MAX=25
DB_POOL_MIN=5
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Health Check Endpoint

The system now includes automatic health monitoring. You can also check status programmatically:

```typescript
import { checkDatabaseHealth, getConnectionPoolStatus } from './server/database-adapter';

// Check if database is healthy
const isHealthy = await checkDatabaseHealth();

// Get pool status
const poolStatus = getConnectionPoolStatus();
```

### Error Logging

Enhanced error logging now provides:
- Connection pool status
- Retry attempts and delays
- Recovery actions taken
- Specific error categorization

### Log Patterns to Monitor

Watch for these log patterns in production:

```
üö® Database error in [operation]: Max client connections reached
üîÑ Database operation recovered after N attempts
‚ö†Ô∏è Database health check failed, attempting recovery...
‚úÖ Database connection recovered successfully
```

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Load Testing**: Simulate high concurrent database operations
2. **Connection Exhaustion**: Monitor behavior under connection pressure
3. **Recovery Testing**: Temporarily disconnect database to test recovery
4. **Health Monitoring**: Verify automatic health checks work

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, you can temporarily increase limits:

```bash
# Emergency high limits (use temporarily)
DB_NO_LIMITS=true
DB_POOL_MAX=200
DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT=0
DB_MAX_LIFETIME=0
```

## Performance Impact

- **Positive**: Fewer connection failures, better error recovery
- **Memory**: Slightly higher due to more connection objects
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead from health monitoring
- **Network**: More stable connection usage

## Next Steps

1. Deploy with recommended environment variables
2. Monitor connection pool metrics
3. Adjust limits based on actual usage patterns
4. Consider implementing PgBouncer if not already available
5. Set up alerts for connection pool exhaustion

## Support

If connection issues persist after implementing these fixes:

1. Check database server connection limits
2. Verify network stability between app and database
3. Review database server performance metrics
4. Consider database server scaling if needed
